# Absence Tracking Tool
A comprehensive tool that helps students of Faculty of Engineering in Cairo University  
to keep track of their absence.

## Overview 
As is the case with most universities worldwide, a student is being
deprived of the final exam in case of missing more than 25% of 
lectures. Thus, **this tool was designed for Cairo University,
Faculty of Engineering students** to help them track their 
absence.

## How to Use
**1. Choose the course that you want to check its absence.** 

**2. Enter the number of lectures and tutorials you already missed, then check.**

## How it works 
As in Faculty of Engneering, Cairo Univeristy. Absence system 
is caculated by points. Each group of courses has a limit of points
that the student can not exceed, also lecture and tutorials have
different weights.

Ex: A course with a limit of 10 points, a lecture counts for 2 points, and a tutorial counts for one. What are the possibilities that a student could miss? and what if I told you that he already missed one lecture before?. \
Instead of doing these calculations every time you need to miss a lecture, you could simply use the tool :").
